export const aboutMe = `I am a passionate technologist with a unique blend of skills in Data Analysis, Network Administration, and Full Stack Web Development. My journey started with a strong foundation in IT, but my curiosity led me to the cutting edge of Web3 and Blockchain.

I specialize in building production-ready applications using Next.js and React, while also diving deep into smart contract development on Stacks and Farcaster. I don't just write code; I craft solutions that are efficient, scalable, and visually stunning.

When I'm not coding, I'm analyzing data trends or exploring the latest in decentralized tech. I'm always ready for a challenge—let's build something amazing together.`;
